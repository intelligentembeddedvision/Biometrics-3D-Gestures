## Summary

As more and more people tend to work using Artificial Intelligence, the possibilities begin to be endless. 
The staggering evolutions that came in over the years made lots of things obsolete, including certain researches made before 2020.

The dataset used in this project, at that time, was using a camera that would be out of today's standards (PMD[vision] CamCube 3.0 ToF camera) for lots of new scientific researchers in the domain.
This updated code (and repository) aims to practice hand segmentation in real-time using an Intel RealSense D435i, a camera that is a lot affordable and has a better API that it's predecessor.

## Potential upgrades to this project

The goal of this project is to make something autonomously usable for everyone. We can reuse the previously calculated point clouds generated by the program to create a PointNet model that can be used in a real-time process, on other instances.

## Launch the program

```
python all_in_one.py
```
