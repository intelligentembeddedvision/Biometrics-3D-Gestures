TBD:

Normalization with camera distance?


 
Segmentation improvement

Add additional features
Features rotation invariant????

Add constrains with respect to distances between vertices

Implement other classifier: kNN, ANN, SVM, random forest
Use 2D contour in classification

Study the influence of Kg, # of hisogram bins, distance, histogram normalization

Validate the method on simple geometric shapes (sphere, cube, ...)
=======================================================================
ALLREADY DONE:
Implement leave one out distance-based classification scheme for entire database 
Total Error Evaluation
Index-Gesture Mapping
Nullify pi/2 from histogram – background influence
